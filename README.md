# Weather Prediction Using PySpark 🌦️

This project implements a **weather prediction system** using **PySpark**, designed to efficiently handle and analyze large-scale weather datasets. The application is deployed [here](https://weather-prediction-using-pyspark.onrender.com).  

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Scalable Data Processing:** Utilizes PySpark for handling large datasets.
- **Weather Predictions:** Predicts weather conditions using machine learning algorithms.
- **Interactive Interface:** A user-friendly web application to visualize and interact with predictions.
- **Deployment:** Hosted using Render for seamless access.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **PySpark:** For distributed data processing and ML model implementation.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** For weather predictions (e.g., regression or classification models).
- **Flask/Django:** For building the web interface.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** For front-end development.
- **Render:** For deployment.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **Python** (Version 3.8 or above)
2. **Apache Spark** (Setup instructions [here](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/))
3. Install required Python libraries:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ⚙️ How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-prediction-using-pyspark.git
   cd weather-prediction-using-pyspark
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Start the PySpark server (ensure Spark is installed and set up):
   ```bash
   pyspark
   ```
4. Run the web application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
5. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

---

## 🚦 How It Works

1. **Data Processing:** The system processes raw weather datasets using PySpark, handling missing data, outliers, and scaling features.
2. **Model Training:** Machine learning models are trained using PySpark's MLlib.
3. **Prediction:** The trained model predicts future weather conditions based on user-provided inputs.
4. **Visualization:** Results are displayed via an interactive web interface.

---

## 📊 Sample Datasets

You can use publicly available weather datasets from sources like:
- [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/)
- [Kaggle Weather Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/search?q=weather+dataset)

Place the dataset in the `data/` directory and configure the `app.py` file to load it.

## ✨ Future Enhancements

- Integrating advanced deep learning models for better accuracy.
- Adding real-time weather data API integration.
- Expanding the feature set to include temperature graphs and anomaly detection.
